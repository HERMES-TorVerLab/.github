# HERMES-TorVerLab

HERMES-TorVerLab (High Efficiency Research on Multicore and Engineered Systems) is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) research laboratory based at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”.
The lab focuses on the design, analysis, and optimization of algorithms and software for modern high-performance and heterogeneous computing systems.

# Research Focus

Our research activities span several core areas of HPC, including:

- Parallel algorithms and scalable numerical methods

- Sparse linear algebra and scientific computing

- GPU and accelerator-based computing

- Heterogeneous and hybrid architectures (CPU/GPU systems)

- Energy-efficient and performance-portable HPC software

We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementations, developing methods and tools that scale efficiently on current and next-generation supercomputing platforms.
